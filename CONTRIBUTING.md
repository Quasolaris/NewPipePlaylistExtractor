As the project is small, there are not many rules for the moment:
- Comment newly written code if needed
- Change the README and Android Guide if functionalities change
- Test your code before requesting a Merge or Review
- Commit Message Format
  - [ACTION] - MESSAGE
  - Example: `[ADD] - Added CSV format to be exported`
  - Possible actions:
    - ADD
    - CHG (for change)
    - FIX
    - DEL
    - CRT (for created)
    - If an action can not be described with those, write it into the pull request with your three letter assignment and I add it here.
